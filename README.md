# What is E-Learning?
E-Learning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online. In our project, we have implemented this using a teacher-student portal.

There are many terms used to describe learning that is delivered online, via the internet, ranging from Distance Education, to computerized electronic learning, online learning, internet learning and many others. We define eLearning as courses that are specifically delivered via the internet to somewhere other than the classroom where the professor is teaching. It is not a course delivered via a DVD or CD- ROM, video tape or over a television channel. It is interactive in that you can also communicate with your teachers, professors, or other students in class.

E-learning is not just a change of technology. It is part of a redefinition of how we as a species transmit knowledge, skills, and values to younger generations of workers and students. This makes a few predictions of how e-learning and the functions it serves will continue to develop. Learners will have access modules. Some will be Web pages with simple text and graphics. Others may include multimedia simulations. In many fields, e-learning has become the default way to conduct training or to provide education. There are four secrets of e-learning. The first secret is to teach what learners need to learn in the way they most naturally learn. The second secret is to define clear learning objectives. The third secret builds on the first two. It is to focus on the right objectives. The final secret is in the power of testing.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has contributed significantly to the efficiency and effectiveness of the industries and organizations. ICT has also empowered the customer and service recipient by ensuring better services and good control over the process of receipt of services.
